managing system projects

project managers is a job
	
what is a projectsuccessful
	on time
	in budget
	high quality project thatmeets user requirements
	
projecttriange
	time
	cost
	scope
	quality(in the middle)
	
	good
	fast
	cheap
	
	can maximize 2 realistically
		good and cheap =  takes a long time
		one needs to be sacrificed
	
can be initiated at other stages like prelin and initialized
	or can be any or
	
	
project manager is standard in the industry
	and it istnt advisalbe to be filled by a prgramer or a regular manager
	
project manager roles
	project planning
	shceduling
		schedules peoples appetites
	monitoring
		make sure moral is g
	reporting


WBS
	work breakdown structure
	2 chart types
		gant
			(we knnow what those are)
			people prefer montly for some reason
				i mean it feels nice
		pert cpm charts
			program evaluation review
			critical path method
				tasks point to other tasks
			(I like this one :DDD )
			
		
I dentify WBS	
	each task must have details like time, something , and money
	managabe units
	milestones - reference point to monitor progress
	
	
	
how to create WBS
	list task - more complicated than you think
	duration variables that must be taken into account
		size
		human resources
		experience with similar projects
		constraints
	size	
		
		
estimating task duration	
	note: tasks may not scale linearly
	
	
mnager responsibilities
	manage urnover
	job vacancies
	rising salaries
	etc
	
bad practice to deny sick days and vacation leaves
	managers problem is you absent
		better to have sick day than have an unproductive work day

task pattern
	wbs must be arranged logically 
	the pattern is called  a task patternnmultiple successor task
	task box standard
		start
		id
		finish
		duration
	3 pattern types	
		dpendednt task
		multiple successor task	
			multiple tasks can be done in successions if the prereq is done
		multiple predecessor
		
THE CRITICAL PATH	
	delayes that would impact the projects completion date
	important to monitor to not lose moneee
	simple task tat blockes the critical task is called a blocker task
	
	
project monitoring control
	tickets??
	ompare actial progress with the project planning
	
	peer rveies aka __ dpending on the SDLC
		design revies
		code reives
		tesint reviews
	
industry standard for project managers is JIRAH
	as cool integrations in github
	ASK SIR LATER
