 POPULATION
==================================================
population changes
	addition	births
	reductions	deaths
	moving in 	immigraion
	moving out	emigration

population at the end of the peroid
minus 
pop at the start of the period

equals
birth minus deaths
plus
immigration minus emmigration

crude bith rate
	number of births per 1000 people
	usually annually
	and same for crude death rates
	

	
life expectancy at birth
death rates	
	age specific death rates
	
current life expectancy in the philippines = 57

==================================================

history of demographic transition
	transition of birth and death rates reflecting industrilization
	
	1 pre tansition
		high fertility
		high mortality
		primary agricultural production
		1766-1843
		deprivation, conficts, wars, and diseases reduce the populations
			mathusioan check
				natural conflicts that cause people to die
			preventative check	
				consenting to not have babies
	2 early transition
		start of 19th century
		high fertility
		lower mortality
		mostly cuz improvement of healthcare, public measures, nutrition
			+ survival rate from airborne and waterborne diseases
		development of developing countries came aftrer
			came into after ww2
	3 late transition
		low fertility
		low mortality
		societal ideas about contraception and womens status
	4 post transition
		low fertility
		low mortality
		negative population growth
		peak of socio economic progress
		
		
		dependency ratios
			child = 0-14
			working = 15-64
			old age = 65+
			
		child dependency ratio
			= child/working
		age dependency ratio
			= old/working
		
==================================================
 CONSEQUNCES OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION
==================================================


PROS
	fewer children = greater investmets per child
	longer lives = 
		more time for non-child-rearing-activities
		longer disability-free years
		multigeneratoin fams are more common
	
	incresased old age dependency = pressure on social safety nets for the elderly
	
	migration flows mitigate acute effects in specific areas
		capital flow to less developed countries with higher returns on capital
