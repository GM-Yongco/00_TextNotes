 FUNCTIONS
==================================================

realtion vs function
	relation is a mapping of any numbers to any numbers
		can be one to many and many to one
		can be one to one and below
	functions are relations tha have limitations
		cant be one to many
		but can be many to one
	graphically, functions cant have any points with the same x value
		basically saying cant be one to many
		vertical line testing
		assuming it is a mapping of x to y
		
well defined function
	to guarantee the function is not empty
	has at least one element to satisfy the function
	
f(a) = b where 
	a is an element of A
	b is an element of B
	
	a is the pre-image of b under f
	b is the image of a under f

	A is the domain of f
	B is the codomain of f
		the possible outputs before the function is defined
	
	range is the set of outputs of the function
		set of all b?
		range will always be found within the codmain
		range is unknown until the output/function is defined
	
	note: a function doesnt have to map all of its domain to a codomain
		ex: f: R->R where f(x) = 1/x
			x = 0 doesnt map to anything 
	
ex 
	f:R->R 
		where R is the set of all real numbers
		where f(x) = x^2
		where x is an element of R
	domain and co domain is R
		the possible outputs before the function is defined
	range is R+ U {0}
		range will always be found within the codmain
		range is unknown until the output/function is defined
	note f:R->R defines the domain and co-domain
		a function where R maps to R
		
==================================================
 OPERATIONS
==================================================
		
we can sum and multiply functions
	f + g 
	
function compositions
	syntax is a hollow circle
	the composition of f of g
		(f o g)(a) = f(g(a)
	the range of g must be a subset of f's domain
	note (f o g) != (g o f)

note: empty set is not finite; you cant quantify nothingness?

==================================================
 KINDS OF FUNCTIONS
==================================================

one-to-one
	injective functions
	every element of its range has only one pre-image
	conditions:
		strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing
			if x > y then f(x) > f(y)
			or
			if > < y then f(x) < f(y)
			can also be the horizontal line test me thinks?
		
many-to-one
	is not a one-to-one function
	
onto property
	surjective
	functions doesnt have to map all of its Domain
	range is equal to the codomain
	
	ex g: R->R where g(x) = x^2 is not onto 
		because the x^2 yeilds only 0 and R+ 
		the R- in the range is not used and therefore not onto
		
==================================================

bijections
	f: A->B the bijection is f^-1:B->A
	
	weird thing identity functions
		ff^-1(x) = x
		the f and the f^-1 cancell each other out
		
Identity functions
	f: A->A
		function where a is an element of A such that f(a) = a


==================================================

if x is an element of R
	floor(-x) = -ceiling(x)
	ceiling(-x) = -floor(x)

if x is an element of Z
	floor(x) = ceiling(x) = x
