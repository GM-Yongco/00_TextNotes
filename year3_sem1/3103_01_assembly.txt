Von Neumann

Von Neumann Architecture
	bottle neck is the bridge between the cpu and the MEMORY
	they didnt have cache and the cpu was a lot faster than reading the memory
		means they had to connect to memory all the time
		cache: lvl 1, lvl 2, lvl 3
	comparisons
		sequential processing
		von neumann bottleneck
		easier
		flexible

Harvard Archtecture
	had 2 memory stores
		one for instruction and data memory
	concurrent access
	comparisons
		parallel processing
		improved speed
		more secure cuz instructions are in ROM
		cant change instructions

==================================================
 INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE
==================================================
	
RISC (Reduced)
	around 60 instructions
	hardware implemented
	consumes less energy, and is a cooler system
	mac and android
CISC (Complex)
	141 instructions
	software implemented
	can do more with less instructions
	intel uses CISC

IBM Set Computer made the instruction set for basically every cpu
	HP
	lenovo
	Acer

ARM(Advanced RISK Machine)

==================================================
 CPU
==================================================

fetch -> decode -> execute -> store -> repeat

program instrution Decoder
	

timing unit
	used to overclock
	controls and paces the CPU
	synchronizes the parts of the computer
	is part of the motherboard
	
main parts
	control unit
		program counter
		sequencer
		OP code converter
		Instruction register
			used to take the instructions from the ram
		Instruction data
		Instruction decoder
	ALU
		does the main math thingies
			math operations
			bit shifting
			logic
			transfer data from registers
			misc(specially programmed operations)
		has stuff
			has its own storage/
				accumulator for arithmetic 
	Register set
		is the storage for the cpu
			note: there is a cache outside the cpu as well
		parts
			PC
			IR
			DR
		is the interface between the ram and the cpu
		note: 16 bit register for class later 

sequencer basically coordinates the cpu parts and then goes to next intruction
	activates one pin at a time for each part of the cpu
	can activate multiple parts at a time
	
==================================================

m1 chip is an SOE (system-on-chip)
	everything is on one chip
	
==================================================
 THINKS TO ASK
==================================================

if arm doesnt have a bios
	does it mean it has a different heirarchy
windows on mac dual boot
how to change OS when in arm architecture
