geometric series sum
	series with non-zero terms
	sum where n = 1 to infinity of a sub n
		where (a sub n) is a function that can be represented as c(r^n)
			c being the first term
			r being the common ratio

		when |r| < 1
			the sum of the seires = (a sub 1)/(1-r)
			/*(a sub 1) aka the first term of the series aka c*/
