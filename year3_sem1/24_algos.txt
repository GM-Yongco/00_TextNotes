Im assigned to morning test # 5 and 56

5
	left
	right
	print

56 is  just math
	honestly idk the formula for this but 
	logically with the first 2 equations x and y are interchangable 
		and the max value for both is 4
		and the bigger multiple in the z equation is 4 paired with y

	x < 4 - y
	z = 12 - y + 4y
	z = 12 + 3y
