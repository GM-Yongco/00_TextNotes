Random signals and coordination theory
	relevant social model characteristics
		society consists of the rich and poor
		rich poor relationship 
			the rich 
				set the tax rate and 
				set the degree of policitcal inclusiveness
			the poor decide to
				revolt or compromise
		revolutions
			may permanently destroy a portion of the countys economic capacity
	poor engage in value calculation
		comparative statistics in change of regime
		assumes the poor can coordinate for protest
			
				
			
Socail media and revolution
	plays a supportive and reinforcing role
		affordable tool to spread information 
	megaphone effect
		people outside the country are more likely to interact with those in protest
	twitter data is 
		predictive in how likely protests will be mobilized
		no direct effect on stock market valuations connected to ruling regime

Fake News
	too much choice effect?
		i think supposedly the paradox of choice
		leads to
			confirmation bias
				only accepting information that validates their belief
			confirmation avoidance
				avoiding information contrary to their beliefs
	Case Study: Snail Mate

==================================================
 DECISIONS
==================================================

Decision Theory
	update beliefs or consme more information
	Bayesian probability
	paradox of choice
		less likely to be satisfied when more options are presendted to them
		aka. 
			choice overload
			too-much-choice effect
		decision making is time-consuming
			makes individuals anxious about their decisions
			choices are only satisfying to experts familiar with their choices
		people try to avoid regrettable decisions
			regret avoidance
				loss adverse?
			hindsight bias
		satiation point
			less satisfying to have less choices
			more likely to be dissatisfied with more choices
		sensitive to task environment
			time limit on large choice pool
				gives greater frustration, regret, and dissatisfaction
				extended time limit only normal dissatisfaction
			

Emotion-driven decisions
	views
		standard
			product of gocnitive revolution
		zajonc
			emotions/the affect matter
			affects predat4es ones codnitive judgement
		slovic
			auto process
			affective stimuli 
	emotions and cognitive aka
		system 1 and 2
		pragmatic and narrative
		experiential and rational
		tacit and deliberate
		continuum of intuitive and analytical
	affect-driven perspective
	
	weird emotion stuff	
		fear and anxietymakes people risk adverse
		anger and excitement makes them risk-seeking
		people easily disgusted are more likely to be conservative
			higher disgust sensitivity predicts disapproval of homosexuals
		emotions influence peoples decisions when they highly anticipate an outcome
	
==================================================
 STUFF UNDER EMOTION-DRIVEN OUTCOMES
==================================================

Moral Judgements

Risks
	old definition
		cognitive exercise of assigning probability to happenings
	risk as a feeling
		people in this feeling feel hightened vividness

Tragic Outcomes
	high emotional conflict when the outcome has high emotional ties
		ex: euthanasia
	risky choices become emotionally charged
		can excite somoene to take risks
		
==================================================
 REACTIONS
==================================================

Comfirmation bias and avoidance
	foundation of fake news
	confirmation avoidance
		avoiding information that poses a threat to the current status quo
	

Viral reactions
	people prefer donaing during natural disasters
		donations to internal affairs dropped by 3.6% in 2013 due to lack of natural disasters that year
		there were more donations for the Haiti earthquake than for the Syrian refugee crisis even tho there were more people affected in the refugee crisis
	second disaster 
		over donating 
		the disaster comes on what to do with the surplus
			logistical problems
	Aylan Kurdi case study
	blood donations case study
		they = french blood service (EFS, a french abrv)
		they had an over abundance of blood donations
		they asked to donate blood later
		they had a shortage of blood in the winter holidays
	Haiyan case study
		58,500 dollars of in kind donations were spoiled
	recommended to donate with money instead of goods
		goods may be inefficient in the certain scenario
	
When good intentions beomce inefficient
	case study
		people donated a lot more to syra refugee stuff with Alan's death
		even tho malaria has be plauging for a long time and still kill 1,200 people a day owo

	in conrast to analytic considerations

Certainty and uncertainty
